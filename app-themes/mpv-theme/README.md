# Jenerated Themes for mpv

Colors for the [mpv](https://mpv.io) media player's own interface, to match
the other themes: the on-screen controller (the play bar that appears over
the video), on-screen messages and the OSD bar, the playlist and other
lists, and the console and its menus. Subtitles and the video itself aren't
touched.

[jenerate.py](../../jenerate.py) writes one folder for each palette you
generate, for example `blue-purple/`, holding `jenerated-blue-purple.conf`.
Blue Purple is included; to add other palettes, see
[Setting up by hand](../../README.md#setting-up-by-hand).

## How the colors are used

| mpv setting | Palette color |
|-------------|---------------|
| Controller background | `bg_chrome` |
| Progress bar and time, pressed buttons | `accent` |
| Title, buttons | `text` (the smaller buttons `text_subtle`) |
| Messages and the OSD bar | `text`, outlined in `bg_chrome` |
| Selected item in lists | `accent_soft` |
| Console menus: focused item | `text_bright` on `accent` |
| Console menus: matched letters | `magenta`, like search matches in the other themes |

Some of these settings are newer than others. The controller's colors need
mpv 0.39 or later, the selected item and console colors 0.40, and the
console's focused item 0.41. Older versions of mpv use what they know, keep
their own colors for the rest, and mention the settings they don't know in
the terminal.

The file is generated from `colors.conf.tmpl` by
[jenerate.py](../../jenerate.py). To change colors, see
[Changing colors](../../README.md#changing-colors).

## Install

The easiest way is `jenerate` (or `./setup.sh` in a clone): choose mpv (under
Entertainment). It links the palette's colors into mpv's settings folder as
`jenerated-colors.conf`, and adds a line to the end of `mpv.conf` that loads
them, creating `mpv.conf` if needed. If you already have an `mpv.conf`, it asks
first, and your settings in it are kept. If mpv was installed through Flatpak,
it does the same in the folder Flatpak gives mpv.

To install by hand, link the palette's file into mpv's settings folder
(`~/.config/mpv`, on macOS too) and load it from `mpv.conf`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/mpv
ln -s "$PWD/jenerated-themes/app-themes/mpv-theme/blue-purple/jenerated-blue-purple.conf" ~/.config/mpv/jenerated-colors.conf
echo 'include="~~/jenerated-colors.conf"' >>~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf
```

If mpv was installed through Flatpak, use
`~/.var/app/io.mpv.Mpv/config/mpv` instead of `~/.config/mpv`.

Then restart mpv. After changing the palette, regenerate its themes and
restart mpv. To switch palettes, run `jenerate` again. To go back to mpv's
own colors, remove the `include` line from `mpv.conf`.
