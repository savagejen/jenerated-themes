# Jenerated Themes for Firefox

[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) themes that match the VS Code
themes: the window, tabs, toolbar, address bar, menus, sidebar and new tab
page. [jenerate.py](../../jenerate.py) writes one folder for each palette you
generate, for example `blue-purple/`, holding the theme's `manifest.json`.
Blue Purple is included; to add other palettes, see
[Getting started](../../README.md#getting-started).

Each theme marks Firefox's own pages as dark or light, to match the palette.
Websites still follow your system's light or dark setting.

Zen Browser is built on Firefox, but draws its own interface, so it has
[its own theme](../zen-theme/).

The manifests are generated from `manifest.json.tmpl` by
[jenerate.py](../../jenerate.py). To change colors, see
[Changing colors](../../README.md#changing-colors).

## Install

The easiest way is `./setup.sh` from the repository root: choose Firefox. It
packages the theme, can open Firefox's add-on page for you, and explains the
steps below.

### Try it (until Firefox restarts)

1. In Firefox, go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
2. Click **Load Temporary Add-on...** and choose the palette's
   `manifest.json`, for example `app-themes/firefox-theme/blue-purple/manifest.json`.

### Keep it

Firefox only keeps add-ons that Mozilla has signed. Signing your own theme is
free, and it stays private (it isn't listed on the add-ons site):

1. Package the theme: `./setup.sh` makes
   `app-themes/firefox-theme/jenerated-<slug>.xpi`, which is just the
   `manifest.json` zipped, with a version number from the date and time.
   Mozilla needs a new version for every upload, so run `./setup.sh` again
   after changing the palette.
2. Go to
   [addons.mozilla.org/developers/addon/submit/distribution](https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/addon/submit/distribution),
   sign in with a Mozilla account, choose **On your own**, and upload the
   `.xpi`.
3. Download the signed file it gives you, and open it in Firefox
   (**File -> Open File**, or drag it onto a Firefox window).

Firefox Developer Edition, Nightly and ESR can also install unsigned themes
permanently, after setting `xpinstall.signatures.required` to `false` in
`about:config`.
