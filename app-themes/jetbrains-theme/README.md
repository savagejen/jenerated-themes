# Jenerated Themes for JetBrains Apps

Themes for the JetBrains apps built on the IntelliJ Platform, version 2023.1
or later:

- IntelliJ IDEA
- Android Studio
- PyCharm
- WebStorm
- PhpStorm
- GoLand
- RubyMine
- CLion
- Rider
- DataGrip
- DataSpell
- RustRover

(Not Fleet, which isn't built on the IntelliJ Platform and has its own theme
format.) Each theme is a small plugin with two parts that match the VS Code
themes:

- a **UI theme** for the window, tool windows, tabs, trees, buttons, popups
  and status bar, and
- an **editor color scheme** for the code, the gutter, search results and the
  console, which the UI theme switches to automatically.

[jenerate.py](../../jenerate.py) writes one folder for each palette you
generate, for example `blue-purple/`, holding the plugin's files:

- `META-INF/plugin.xml`, which describes the plugin,
- `jenerated-<slug>.theme.json`, the UI theme, and
- `jenerated-<slug>.xml`, the editor color scheme.

Blue Purple is included; to add other palettes, see
[Getting started](../../README.md#getting-started).

The files are generated from `plugin.xml.tmpl`, `theme.json.tmpl` and
`editor-scheme.xml.tmpl` by [jenerate.py](../../jenerate.py). To change
colors, see [Changing colors](../../README.md#changing-colors).

## How the colors are used

The UI theme builds on the IDE's own theme for the New UI, dark or light to
match the palette (`"parentTheme": "ExperimentalDark"` or
`"ExperimentalLight"`), which defines the whole UI in terms of
a set of named colors: `Gray1` to `Gray14` from darkest to lightest, and
shades of `Blue`, `Green`, `Yellow`, `Red`, `Orange`, `Purple` and `Teal`. The
theme redefines those names with the palette's colors, so every part of the
IDE follows the palette:

- the grays are the palette's backgrounds (`bg`, `bg_sidebar`, `bg_hover`,
  ...) and its text colors: for a dark palette the backgrounds are the dark
  end and the text the light end, and for a light palette the other way
  round (`theme-dark.json.tmpl` and `theme-light.json.tmpl`),
- the blues are the accent colors, used for selection, focus, default buttons
  and links, and
- the other colors are the palette's `green`, `yellow`, `red`, `orange`,
  `magenta` and `cyan`; their darkest shades, used as tinted backgrounds, are
  those colors made translucent.

The window's toolbar and the status bar use `bg_chrome`, as in VS Code.

The editor color scheme builds on Darcula (or, for a light palette, the
IDE's default light scheme), and sets the same syntax colors as the VS Code
theme, and the same 16 console colors as the terminal themes.

## Install

Blue Purple's plugin is included, ready to install:
[jenerated-blue-purple.jar](jenerated-blue-purple.jar). For other palettes,
the easiest way is `./setup.sh` from the repository root: choose
JetBrains Apps, and it packages the plugin as
`app-themes/jetbrains-theme/jenerated-<slug>.jar`. To package it by hand, zip
the contents of the palette's folder (not the folder itself):

```bash
cd app-themes/jetbrains-theme/blue-purple
zip -r ../jenerated-blue-purple.jar .
```

Then, in the app:

1. Open **Settings -> Plugins**, click the gear icon, and choose
   **Install Plugin from Disk...**.
2. Choose the `.jar`, and restart the app if it asks.
3. Open **Settings -> Appearance & Behavior -> Appearance**, and choose
   **Jenerated Blue Purple** as the theme. Its editor colors come with it.
Note: You may need to select the theme after installing it.

After changing a palette, package and install the `.jar` again; it replaces
the version you installed.
