# Jenerated Themes for Tilix

Color schemes for [Tilix](https://gnunn1.github.io/tilix-web/), the tiling
terminal for Linux. [jenerate.py](../../jenerate.py) writes one `<slug>.json`
file for each palette you generate, for example `blue-purple.json`. Each uses
the same colors as the matching VS Code theme's built-in terminal and the
Ptyxis palette, and shows up in Tilix as "Jenerated" plus the palette's name.

Each scheme uses the palette's colors whether GNOME is set to light or dark
mode.

The `.json` files are generated from `scheme.json.tmpl` by
[jenerate.py](../../jenerate.py). To change colors, see
[Changing colors](../../README.md#changing-colors).

## Install

The easiest way is `./setup.sh` from the repository root: choose Tilix. To
install by hand:

1. Clone this repository. Blue Purple is included; to add other palettes,
   see [Setting up by hand](../../README.md#setting-up-by-hand).

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/savagejen/jenerated-themes jenerated-themes
   ```

2. Symlink or copy the scheme into Tilix's schemes folder. A symlink means
   later changes to the palette show up after you restart Tilix. The
   `jenerated-` prefix keeps it from replacing a scheme of your own with the
   same name. Run these from the same folder where you ran `git clone`.

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/tilix/schemes

   # Symlink (ln needs an absolute path, hence $PWD)
   ln -s "$PWD/jenerated-themes/app-themes/tilix-theme/blue-purple.json" ~/.config/tilix/schemes/jenerated-blue-purple.json

   # Or copy
   cp ./jenerated-themes/app-themes/tilix-theme/blue-purple.json ~/.config/tilix/schemes/jenerated-blue-purple.json
   ```

3. Close every Tilix window and open Tilix again; it only reads schemes when
   it starts.

4. Open **Preferences**, choose your profile under **Profiles**, and on the
   **Color** tab choose **Jenerated Blue Purple** as the color scheme. Tilix
   copies the scheme's colors into the profile, so repeat this for each
   profile, and choose the scheme again after changing the palette.

## Scheme file format

A Tilix scheme is a JSON file. `palette` holds the 16 ANSI colors: the
normal colors (black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white) and
then their bright versions. The cursor uses the palette's accent, and
selected text uses its selection color.
